			       ASSIGNMENT BRIEF

INTRODUCTION

 Rather than working through the entire term's practical exercises
                                AND THEN
           starting a whole new separate assessed exercise


 It would be a whole lot more straightforward to...

           Just use the practical exercises AS the assignment !!!


 This will have the following advantages:

>  o  No extra block of work at the end of the module

>  o  No conflict with other module deadlines at the end of the term

>  o  Encourage people to turn up to practical sessions throughout the term

~
